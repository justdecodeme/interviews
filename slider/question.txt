1. Create a simple page with a Welcome Message and a slider(owl, flex,flickity whatever you want).
2. With every slide move console the event by which its moved, (if navigation or dots clicked, log "click" in console, if its dragged by user log "Drag" in console. 
2. When a user wants to leave the page show him a Pop Up(exit intent pop up).
3. That pop up will have a gradient background and a close button. Check the below image for Reference, (this image is just for your idea, be creative.) 
4. This is not a signup popup(it's an exit-intent popup), so use only 2 fields, Name, and Email with a checkbox for newsletters and a submit button.

On submitting this form:

·  Show error if Email or checkbox value is blank(js or jQuery validation).
·  Successful form submission: create a cookie (form_filled) & auto close the popup.
·  On Closing the popup(by clicking the close button, whether the form is filled or not) a cookie (popUp_closed) will be created. 
·  On refresh: if any of the above-created cookies(i.e. successful submission or close) are present, then an exit-intent popup should not appear.
·  show a button on the main welcome screen now(if the cookie is present), which will delete the cookie, and exit intent popup will show again.
